abstract = {We present a new approach to applying object oriented principles to GPU programming
via GLSL shaders. Using the CLOS Meta Object Protocol, shader code can be attached
to classes within standard Lisp code and is automatically combined by the system according
to inheritance rules. This approach results in a native coupling of both CPU and GPU
logic, while preserving the advantages of object oriented inheritance and behaviour.
The system allows the use of arbitrary shaders written directly in GLSL, without the
need for language extensions.},
